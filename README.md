# Baptistery-Data
A web app to check out and analyse monitoring data of the Baptistery of Pisa. Made with Python and Dash (and love).

## Requirements
The following applications/libraries are required to run the dashboard:
- Python (>= 3.8)
- base Python libraries: numpy 
- plotly Python library
- dash Python library
- dash-bootstrap-components Python library

## How to use
1. Run the command "python baptistery-data.py" in the command line.
2. Wait for the prompt to show the URL on which Dash is running (usually https://127.0.0.1:8050/).
3. Visit the URL (you may be able to CTRL+click on it) and enjoy.
4. To shut down the dashboard, close the command window or CTRL+C it and confirm the shutdown.

## Please know that
- You will need a Data folder to run the app â€” it contains the actual monitoring data. At the moment, we are unfortunately unable to share it, but in the near future we'll try to create a dummy folder with dummy data, so that anyone can check out the app.
- The app is a prototype, so it currently runs only in development mode (i.e., locally). Deployment to a server is a work in progress.

## Whodunit?
The following people worked at developing this app:
- Carlo Resta (University of Pisa)
- Giada Bartolini (University of Pisa)
- Laura Vignali (University of Pisa)
