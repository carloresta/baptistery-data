# Baptistery-Data
A web app to check out and analyse monitoring data of the Baptistery of Pisa. Made with Python and Dash (and love).

## Merge and migration
Development is no longer active in this channel. The application was merged into MoMir, which was then adopted by
laura-v22 (Laura Vignali). You can find it here:
